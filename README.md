# Undergrad_Telecom_Research  

**Undergraduate Research in Telecommunications**  

This repository contains MATLAB simulation scripts developed during my undergraduate research program in Electrical Engineering, focusing on telecommunications. The studies address different aspects of **signal propagation** and **power allocation** in wireless communication systems.  

## Repository Structure  

The repository is organized into thematic folders:  

```

### ðŸ“‚ **Propagation_and_SINR/**  
- **PropagationAndSINR.m** â€“ MATLAB script for simulating propagation effects and calculating the **Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR)**.  

### ðŸ“‚ **Power_Allocation/**  
- **Hughes-Hartogs/**  
  - **HughesHartogs.m** â€“ Implementation of the **Hughes-Hartogs** algorithm for optimal power allocation.  
- **Water-Filling/**  
  - **WaterFilling.m** â€“ Implementation of the **Water-Filling** algorithm for power distribution in communication channels.  

## How to Use  
Each script contains comments explaining the parameters and execution steps. To run a specific simulation, navigate to the corresponding folder and execute the MATLAB script.
